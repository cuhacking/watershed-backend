# Watershed (Under Construction :construction: :construction_worker: :sweat_drops:)

Water is part of something bigger than a drop (us and the tech industry) and also cool since Carleton does have a lot of water surrounding it I think it fits well. And the fact it's made of triangle shapes also shows how it's built from various pieces, sorta like a hack.

wa·ter·shed, _noun_, an area or ridge of land that separates waters flowing to different rivers, basins, or seas.
